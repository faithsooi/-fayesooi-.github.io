            <h2>Welcome to Loyola High School.</h2>
            <p style="margin-right:10px">Loyola High School is a Jesuit Secondary School offering quality education. 
                It is a Catholic School open to both boys and girls of all religious persuasions. Loyola High School (Dar es Salam) was formed in 1989 when the late Fr. Louis Plamondon, SJ was appointed to organise the building project. It was decided that Dar es Salam in Tanzania was the area in greatest need of good schools. Of the many plots offered by the Tanzanian government, Mabibo Farasi was the suburb chosen by the Jesuits for building. They wished to offer quality education for those who could not afford to study otherwise. The first building (Block V) began in 1994 and was completed in 1995, followed by the Jesuit residence, Block VI and the temporary canteen in 1996. This was followed by Block IV in 2000, Block III in 2002 and the chapel was recently completed on 4 May 2011.
                In July 1995, Fr. Richard Twohig, SJ from the Detroit Province of the Society of Jesus, arrived as the first Headmaster of the school. He admitted the first batch of students: 70 girls and 70 boys for the first Pre¬-Form One (now known as HDP) program. Hence Loyola is a mixed school.
                Loyola was officially inaugurated by the Provincial Superior Fr. Fratern Masawe, SJ on October 5, 2002.</p>

                <h2>School staff </h2>
                <p>At present Loyola has a total of one thousand four hundred and thirty eight (1438) students, out of whom 439 are girls and 949 are boys.
                With regard to staff, there are 63 teachers out of whom 17 (30%) are female and the rest are male. Of these, 51 hold a bachelor’s degree, 5 hold a master’s degree and 7 hold a diploma.</p>
               <h2> School Vision. </h2>
               <p> Loyola stands for excellence in both academics and human formation. 
                The goal held out to all students at Loyola High School is integrated personal development as individuals and as members of the larger society.
                 Each student therefore is challenged to develop fully with a vibrant desire to work for the development
                  of the neighbor and of the nation, and that each student progressively becomes a better person and therefore a person for others.</p>

                <h2>School Mission.</h2>

                    the common good.</p>
